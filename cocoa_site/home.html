        <p>Cultivated for over 3,000 years by the Olmecs and later by the Mayan and Aztec civilizations, <strong>cocoa</strong> beans were considered sacred and used as currency. The Mayans prepared a frothy, bitter beverage called “xocolātl,” blending ground beans with water, chili peppers, and spices. After the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, cocoa was introduced to Europe, where sugar and milk transformed it into the sweet chocolate we know today.</p>

        <p>By the 17th century, chocolate houses appeared in England and France, becoming fashionable social hubs. The invention of the hydraulic press in 1828 by Coenraad van Houten allowed separation of cocoa butter from solids, making chocolate more affordable and paving the way for solid chocolate bars. <em>Today, chocolate</em> is enjoyed around the world in countless forms.</p>
