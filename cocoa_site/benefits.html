        <h1>Health Benefits of Cocoa</h1>
        <img src="images/health-1.jpg" alt="Dark chocolate" class="float-right">
        <p>Rich in antioxidants and flavonoids, cocoa has been shown to improve mood, support heart health, and enhance cognitive function. Consuming moderate amounts of dark chocolate can provide a natural boost of pleasure and well-being thanks to its ability to increase endorphin and serotonin levels.</p>
        <h2>Rich in Flavonoids</h2>
        <p>Cocoa is one of the richest dietary sources of flavonoids, particularly epicatechin. These powerful antioxidants help reduce inflammation, improve blood vessel function, and lower LDL cholesterol, all of which contribute to better cardiovascular health.</p>
        <h3>Blood Pressure</h3>
        <p>Studies suggest that the flavonoids in cocoa promote nitric oxide production in the endothelium, helping to relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure. Regular, moderate consumption may result in modest but significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic levels.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Choose at least 70% cocoa content for maximum health benefits.</p>
