        <p>Cocoa beans were once so valuable that the Aztecs used them as currency, trading 100 beans for a turkey. The worldâ€™s largest chocolate bar weighed over 5,740 pounds! Today, over 4 million tons of cocoa are harvested annually, with <em>West Africa</em> supplying more than 70% of the global crop. It's <strong>truly</strong> the food of the gods.</p>

        <h2 id="cocoa-varieties">Cocoa Varieties</h2>
        <p>There are three main varieties of cocoa: <strong>Forastero</strong>, which makes up the majority of global production and offers a robust, earthy flavor; <strong>Criollo</strong>, a rare strain prized for its delicate aroma and complex taste; and <strong>Trinitario</strong>, a hybrid combining the hardiness of Forastero with the fine flavor of Criollo.</p>
