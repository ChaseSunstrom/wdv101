            <h2>Welcome to the Koala Bear National Information Center!</h2>
            <p>In this site you can learn about Koala bears, adopt a Koala, give to our foundation, sign up for our newsletter, or schedule a visit. Please take some time to explore the information provided in this site!</p>

            <p>The Koala Bear National Information Center (KBNIC) is the principal <strong>non-profit</strong>, <em>non-government</em> organization dedicated to the conservation and effective management of the wild koala and its habitat.</p>

            <p>The KBNIC was formed in 2006. Since our founding the KBNIC has grown from a small group of people interested in researching koala disease, to a well-known, global organization with a strong track record in strategic koala research, conservation and community education with a huge focus on mapping -- our absolute strength.</p>

            <p>Koalas are disappearing. Loss of koala habitat and koala food trees (eucalyptus leaves) is the leading koala threat. Our cuddly koalas are loved around the world. Often called a koala bear, they are actually <strong>marsupials</strong> not koala bears. Please help koalas by supporting the Australian Koala Foundation.</p>
